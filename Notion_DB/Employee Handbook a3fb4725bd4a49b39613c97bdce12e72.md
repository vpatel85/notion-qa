## 1.0 Introduction

Welcome to Fueled! You have just joined a dedicated, passionate team. We hope that your employment with Fueled will be rewarding and challenging. We take pride in our employees as well as the work we produce.

Please take the time now to read this employee handbook carefully. This handbook supersedes any previously issued handbooks or policy statements dealing with the subjects discussed herein. Fueled reserves the right to interpret, modify, or supplement the provisions of this handbook at any time.

Please understand that no employee handbook can address every situation in the workplace. If you ever have questions about your employment, you are encouraged to ask them. If you have any difficulty reading or understanding any of the provisions of this handbook, please contact the People Operations team. Likewise, if you have any suggestions related to company policies or procedures, please let us know. We wish you success in your employment here at Fueled!

### *1.2 About the Company*

Fueled was originally founded in 2007 (as Design Vacancy), and then evolved into Fueled in 2010. We are approximately 102 people as of December 2020. Our primary offices are in New York City, London, and Noida (Uttar Pradesh, India). Fueled also has satellite offices in Newcastle upon Tyne, England and Novosibirsk, Russia as well as remote team members all over the globe.

Fueled’s flagship offering is Digital Transformation Accelerated. We are an award-winning technology consultancy that transforms businesses by generating ideas, building products, and accelerating growth. In other words, we help companies figure out how they can generate new and expanded revenue by creating value for new and existing customers in the form of consumer-facing digital products like apps and websites.

When clients utilize our full offering of services, it means we take a project from opportunity analysis through the design and build process and then through launch, growth, and iteration.

We would start with an initial investigation about our client and their industry. We identify openings for growth, efficiency gains, and innovation by leveraging off-the-shelf or custom tech implementations. We interview stakeholders, do research, host focus groups, dive into analytics, and review data. That leads us to an understanding of what opportunities exist and what it will take to exploit them. We figure out ROI and what a roadmap would look like; we flesh out some concepts. And then we execute.

Of course, not every client needs our full suite of services, and around half our business is focused on providing our capabilities a la carte. We work with a wide range of clients across numerous types of engagements, so flexibility is key, but we’ll never compromise our commitment to modern, agile best practices across product, design, development, growth, and project management.

We've built award-winning iPhone, iPad and Android apps used by millions of people for clients ranging from Fortune 100 companies to up-and-coming startups, including Barneys, Coca Cola, QuizUp, JackThreads and MTV. To date, our apps have processed over $500 million in revenue. Our clients have raised millions in funding and seen nine-figure valuations.

Our apps have been featured in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Wired, TechCrunch, Mashable, and just about every other publication you can think of. We've won our fair share of design awards, but some of our proudest achievements to date include being featured in both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and hitting #1 on both the paid and free charts.

### *1.3 Vis*ion and *Mission Statement*

Vision: To optimize the user-experience of the world.

Mission: As technology continuously changes our world, we lead businesses through digital transformations that win because they delight users and empower our clients.

### 1.4 About this Handbook

This handbook sets out the main policies and procedures that you will need to be aware of and adhere to while working at Fueled. Any questions you may have with regard to its contents should be referred to your manager or the People Operations team. The policies and procedures set out in this handbook apply to every team member and do not form part of the terms of your contract(s) with us, which are provided to you separately.

All managers have a specific responsibility to operate in accordance with the provisions set out in this handbook. This is important for the following reasons:

- to set an appropriate standard of behavior
- to ensure that all team members understand the standards of behavior expected of them and to take action when behavior falls below those requirements
- to lead by example and ensure that those they manage adhere to the policies and procedures and promote our company objectives with regard to equal opportunities

Every team member should take the time to read and fully understand the contents of this handbook, act in accordance with its aims and objectives, and ensure that they are compliant with its policies and procedures.

## 2.0 Working at Fueled

### ***2.1 New Hire Check In***

After your first three months of employment, your manager will conduct a performance review in order to provide you with feedback on your performance and allow you to share any concerns of your own. Feedback will be requested from you, your peers, and any direct reports you may have, and if any performance issues are raised, a written warning will be issued with the intent of setting specific benchmarks that must be met / course correcting as is necessary. Potential outcomes of this written warning may include demotion or termination.

### *2.2 Attendance*

Fueled expects our team members to be present at all scheduled meetings on time every scheduled workday, but we also understand that life happens and sometimes things come up unexpectedly. If you know ahead of time that you will need to be late or absent, provide as much advance notice as possible to your manager and any relevant team members. Those with repeated unplanned and/or uncommunicated absences or tardiness will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Team members who fail to report to work for three consecutive business days without notifying Fueled and remain unreachable or unresponsive to communication from the Operations team will be considered as having voluntarily resigned as a result of job abandonment.

If you are unable to contact Fueled in the event of an absence, you should ask a representative (a family member or friend) to do so on your behalf. If there are extreme circumstances such as a medical emergency or natural disaster that prohibits you or your representative from contacting us within three days, you must contact us as soon as practicable to explain the situation. In extreme circumstances, Fueled will consider the explanation and its timing before determining if any voluntary resignation will be upheld.

### *2.3 Job Descriptions*

Fueled attempts to maintain a job description for each active position at the organization. If you do not have a copy of your current job description, you should request one from your manager. Please note, however, that job descriptions at Fueled serve only as an outline of your duties within your role. Due to the needs of the business, you may be required to perform job duties not within your written job description from time to time.

Furthermore, Fueled reserves the right to revise, amend, or remove from your job duties according to company needs. On occasion, Fueled may need to revise job descriptions with or without advance notice; in either event, we will endeavor to alert relevant team members of these revisions as soon as possible.

If you have any questions regarding your job description or the scope of your duties, please speak with your manager or the People Operations team.

### *2.4 Reviews, Promotions, and Raises*

While we encourage a culture of continuous feedback, Fueled does hold formal performance reviews every six months—one in July (mid-year) and one in January (end of year). During these review cycles, feedback on your performance is gathered from you, your peers (both in your department and on your project teams), your manager, and any direct reports you may have. Once this feedback is collected and reviewed, there will be a face-to-face meeting with your manager to discuss this feedback. Each January, you will be evaluated for a raise and/or promotion, though neither is guaranteed. Please reach out to your manager with any questions about your career trajectory and/or to discuss expected milestones.

Fueled encourages and invests in our team members' growth and professional development, and we want (and expect) everyone to demonstrate increasing mastery of competencies and disciplines. At the same time, we generally have the expectation that each team member will maintain their position for at least a year before moving on to a new role, in an effort to maximize both the team member's personal development and the growth of Fueled. Additionally, a team member’s eligibility for a promotion (or other change in role) will depend upon such roles being available and/or beneficial to the business. Additionally, in certain circumstances, positions may become available throughout the year, which may or may not trigger a promotion.

Promotions are made on an equal opportunity basis according to the team member possessing the needed skills, experience, and other qualifications that are required for the role. It is our policy to promote from within only when an existing team member has proven themselves to be fully qualified for the role.

### *2.5 Expenses*

Fueled team members will be reimbursed for any necessary business-related expenses, but only if the expenses are adequately substantiated as described below.

- All expenses must be submitted through Abacus within 30 days or less after the expense is incurred, with a receipt
- To substantiate an expense, team members must provide adequate records of:
    - The amount of the expense
    - The date and time of the expense
    - Where applicable, the place of any travel
    - Where applicable, names of attendees for any meals
    - The business purpose of the expense

Please refer to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qdB8dfkoDDtgiCut9oHK_km8dTOlGEEZxm03OBI7QfU/edit) for a full description of the expense reimbursement policy & process.

### *2.6 Travel*

**Billable**

The most common reasons for client travel are pitches and working on-site at a client's office. Travel for client needs is typically billable, and terms are outlined in our Letter of Engagement (LOE) with the client. The Project Manager on the project manages the travel budget and books travel and lodging unless otherwise requested by the team member.

**Non-Billable**

On occasion, Fueled will ask team members to travel to other office locations for business reasons, such as but not limited to remote team members onboarding on location with their manager/team. In these instances, People Operations will book the travel and lodging unless otherwise requested by the team member. The traveling team member will also be allowed to expense up to a certain amount per day for their food and transportation costs, which will be specified in an email from People Ops one week before the travel occurs.

**Interoffice**

We believe that it’s important to get an opportunity to meet your co-workers in person, in order to form closer relationships and strengthen team collaboration. After you’ve completed your first year of employment at Fueled, we will endeavor to sponsor travel to one of our other major offices and/or an additional destination with other team members from around the world within the first 18 months following your anniversary date. Please reach out to People Operations if you have any further questions about interoffice travel.

**Conferences**

Each year, Fueled will select groups of team members to attend learning and development opportunities such as WWDC, Google I/O, and PyCon. Selection depends on various factors such as tenure, performance, and the relevance of the conference to one’s role.

For those selected to attend, People Operations will book the travel and lodging unless otherwise requested by the team member. The traveling team member will also be allowed to expense up to a certain amount per day for their food and transportation costs, which will be specified in an email from People Ops one week before the travel occurs. The cost to attend the conference will also be paid for by Fueled. Those who attend a Fueled-sponsored conference will be unlikely to receive additional Learning & Development budget in the same calendar year.

**Self-Initiated**

We understand that sometimes the best way to support our team members' effectiveness is with a degree of geographic flexibility, especially when there's synergy with members' responsibility. This unofficial, elective travel is subject to approval by your manager, based on factors such as, but not limited to, past performance, independence and accountability, as well as any logistical concerns that might affect your ability to perform your role. Furthermore, any and all expenses associated with elective travel are the responsibility of the member undertaking such travel.

**Relocation**

Requests to permanently relocate, as well as assistance with associated expenses, will be considered on a case-by-case basis, considering the team member’s tenure, performance, reporting structure, and accountability, among other factors. If you are interested in relocating, please reach out to your Department Head, who will then escalate to People Ops and the Managing Director. If the request to relocate is approved, you will receive a new offer letter which will include your proposed compensation (taking into account changes in currency, cost of living, and market rate, among other things) and any potential changes in scope. Relocation will commence once the updated terms of employment are mutually agreed to. Additionally, the team member will be subject to an 8-16 week probationary period upon relocation. Following such relocation, the team member will have to adhere to the policies and terms and conditions of the contract of their new country of residence.

### *2.7 Work Attire*

Team members are encouraged to express themselves and their sense of style through clothing, body art, jewelry, and so on—get creative! You are expected, however, to maintain personal hygiene habits that are generally accepted in the community (i.e. appropriate hygiene etiquette) in order to support a productive environment for your colleagues.

If you have any questions about the aforementioned or require special accommodations, please contact the People Operations team.

### *2.8 Religious Accommodation*

Fueled is dedicated to treating the religious diversity of all our team members equally and with respect. Team members may request an accommodation when their religious beliefs cause a deviation from Fueled's dress code, schedule, basic job duties, or other aspects of employment. We will consider the request but reserve the right to offer our own accommodation to the extent permitted by law. Some, but not all, of the factors that we will consider are cost, the effect that an accommodation will have on current established policies and the burden on operations, including other team members, when determining a reasonable accommodation. We will always endeavor not to question the validity of someone's beliefs.

### *2.9 Social Events*

Fueled holds periodic social events for the team, such as, but not limited to: happy hours, panel events, and holiday/seasonal parties. Be advised that your attendance at these events is voluntary and does not constitute as part of your work-related duties unless otherwise communicated by your manager.

Alcoholic beverages may be available at these events. If you choose to drink alcoholic beverages, you must do so in a responsible manner. Do not drink and drive. Instead, please call a taxi/car service or appoint a designated driver.

## 3.0 Time Off

### ***3.1 Holidays***

Because Fueled is a global organization, we do not follow one specific calendar for national holidays. Instead, we are happy to offer all of our full-time team members the flexibility of selecting 12 floating holidays per calendar year, which are paid and offered separately from Fueled’s vacation and other PTO policies. These holidays must be selected for the entire year by November 1 of the prior year or within the first week of employment. For new hires, the number of floating holidays is prorated to one holiday per month remaining in the year (e.g. if someone starts in May, they would be entitled to 7 days).

There are no stipulations on what you may select as a floating holiday; if you have trouble coming up with enough national holidays to choose, consider selecting personal days of recognition (such as birthdays or anniversaries). **In addition to any floating holidays taken, Fueled is closed for a long weekend (2 working days) in July and one week (5 working days) in December, between Christmas and New Year’s Day.**

Note: It is required by national mandate that all team members in India select Independence Day, Republic Day, and Gandhi Jayanti as three of their floating holidays. Other countries may have similar mandatory holidays, which we will make clear at the time of discovery.

All floating holidays must be logged in Justworks under the *Floating Holidays* policy. Please include a description of the holiday (e.g. “Thanksgiving,” “Diwali,” “Birthday”) when you submit in Justworks. Changes to your selected floating holidays after the submission date must be approved by People Ops.

### ***3.2 Vacation Policy***

Fueled believes that taking time away from the office for relaxation, travel, and other personal pursuits is critical to both the health of our team members and the business. Thus, we are more than happy to offer an unlimited vacation policy (no set number of days per year), with pay.

Typically, two consecutive weeks is the maximum amount of time off that will be approved at one time. Requests for more than two consecutive weeks off will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

However, not all time-off requests are guaranteed to be approved. The variables taken into consideration include, but are not limited to: the individual's performance, their workload, time off already scheduled for other members of their team, and the amount of notice given. In order to give yourself the best chance at receiving approval for time off, please submit all requests as far in advance as possible:

- Requests for 1-2 days must be submitted at least **2 weeks** in advance
- Requests for 3-5 consecutive days must be submitted at least **8 weeks** in advance
- Requests for anything more than one week of consecutive time off must be submitted at least **12 weeks** (1 quarter) in advance

Please also note that requests for more than 3 days that are made fewer than 8 weeks in advance will only be approved if appropriate project coverage is available.

We always try to approve all requests regardless of notice, but **we may need to ask for some flexibility** if you submit with less notice than stated in the policy.

Fueled believes that accountability and trust are big parts of our culture and part of what makes the company such a great place to work; we trust everyone not to take advantage of this policy. However, management will take any disciplinary action deemed necessary should we determine that a team member is abusing this policy. Additionally, Fueled team members will **not** be paid out for any vacation, sick, or personal time upon separation from the company.

Please submit all vacation requests in Justworks under the *Vacation* policy. 

### ***3.3 Sick / Personal Time Off***

All of Fueled’s full-time team members are entitled to up to 12 days of sick or personal time off per year, with pay. This time off may be used to recover from illness, or to take a personal / mental health day. Once all sick time off has been depleted, a team member will be entitled to the statutory requirement of their office location—please see People Ops for more information on this.

Paid sick time off or personal days may be requested less than 24 hours in advance, though we ask that requests be submitted as far in advance as possible. Please submit all requests in Justworks under the *Sick / Personal Time Off* policy, and be sure to contact your manager directly for all same-day requests and post in the #sickday Slack channel so all relevant stakeholders can be informed in a timely manner. Note that all team members’ sick and personal time off allotment will be prorated according to their start date within the year, and sick or personal time taken in excess of a team member’s allotment will contribute to their minimum PTO calculation.

For absences of more than three consecutive days, you must obtain a certificate from your doctor stating that you are not fit for work and the reason(s) why. This should be forwarded to your manager as soon as possible. If your absence continues, further medical certificates must be provided to cover the whole period of absence. If your doctor provides a certificate stating that you "may be fit for work," you should inform your manager immediately. We will discuss with you any additional measures that may be needed to facilitate your return to work, taking account of your doctor's advice. If appropriate measures cannot be taken, you will remain on sick leave and we will set a date to review the situation.

Where we are concerned about the reason for absence, or frequent short-term absence, we may require a medical certificate for each absence regardless of duration. In such circumstances, we will cover any costs incurred in obtaining such medical certificates for absences of a week or less, on production of a doctor's invoice.

We may, at any time in operating this policy, require you to consent to a medical examination by a doctor nominated by us (at our expense). You will be asked to agree that any report produced in connection with any such examination may be disclosed to us and that we may discuss the contents of the report with our advisers and the relevant doctor. Management will take any disciplinary action deemed necessary should we determine that a team member is abusing this policy.

### ***3.4 Bereavement Leave***

Fueled recognizes the need for and importance of team members taking time off in the event of the death of a loved one. To that end, all full-time team members are allowed up to five (5) consecutive days of paid bereavement leave. This policy is also extended to grieving parents (including partners) following a pregnancy loss. Fueled understands the deep impact that death can have on an individual or a family; therefore, a team member may be allowed additional days off at the discretion of the company, depending on the individual circumstances of each case. It is our intention to support team members during their times of grief and bereavement.

Bereavement leave will be granted for reasons such as:

- Arranging and/or attending a funeral or memorial service
- Resolving matters of inheritance
- Fulfillment of family obligations
- Personal mourning

Bereavement leave may be requested less than 24 hours in advance. Please submit all requests in Justworks under the *Bereavement Leave* policy, and be sure to contact your manager, department head, and People Ops directly for all same-day requests so all relevant stakeholders can be informed in a timely manner.

### ***3.5 Working Out of Office***

In order to provide a more flexible work environment and help deal with those "life happens" moments, Fueled is happy to offer some policies for working outside of the office. This is broken down into the following:

### **Working Remotely**

This is used in the event that a team member will be working while traveling, and potentially working a different set of hours. All requests for remote work must be submitted for approval at least one week in advance. Please submit all requests under the *Working Remotely* policy in Justworks, and be sure to inform your team of your working schedule if it will be different from the norm. Working Remotely does not apply to those traveling as a part of Fueled’s interoffice travel program. Any team members who do not follow proper process when working remotely may be subject to disciplinary action, including the loss of remote working privileges.

### **Traveling for Work**

This is used in the event that a team member will be offline due to traveling for work purposes. Some examples of this are days spent on flights for interoffice travel, project-related travel, client on-sites, or attending a Fueled-approved, work-related conference such as WWDC or Google I/O. If you will be offline due to traveling for work, you must inform your Project Managers (in order to coordinate coverage plans) and submit the request in Justworks under the *Traveling for Work* policy as far in advance as possible.

### ***3.6 Parental Leave***

Congratulations, new parents! Fueled’s parental leave policy works in conjunction with the statutory benefits offered in each of its locations. For more information on statutory parental leave benefits per location, please refer to the location specific policies in Section 7. Please note that a team member must be employed by Fueled for a minimum of one (1) year before they are able to benefit from this policy. All parental leave taken will count toward the team member’s minimum PTO requirement. In either scenario below, submit your time in Justworks under the *Parental Leave* policy. Parental leave will be considered as a period of non-service when calculating year-end bonuses, and amounts will be prorated accordingly.

### **Birthing Parents**

For the first sixteen (16) weeks of parental leave, Fueled will subsidize the required state benefit to ensure that you receive 100% of your usual salary. After the first 16 weeks, you will receive the required state benefit for the duration of your leave. For locations which have a statutory leave requirement that is less than 16 weeks, Fueled will offer new parents an additional unpaid extended leave to subsidize time off up to a total of twenty-four (24) weeks’ leave. Please see People Operations for details on prorated salary payment over the duration of your parental leave, or for more information on the statutory parental leave benefits for your location. This leave may be taken within the first 52 weeks (or one year) of welcoming your child.

### **Non-Birthing Parents**

For the four (4) weeks of parental leave, Fueled will subsidize the required state benefit to ensure that you receive 100% of your usual salary. After this, you will receive the required state benefit for the duration of your leave. This leave may be taken within the first 52 weeks (or one year) of welcoming your child.

### ***3.7 Sabbatical Leave***

Fueled offers sabbatical leave as a benefit to encourage our team members to innovate, rejuvenate, learn, and pursue their passions. It’s one way to reward tenured employees who require some well-deserved, paid time off.

The length of your sabbatical leave is determined by how long you've been continuously employed by Fueled:

- After 4 years, you are entitled to one sabbatical of 4 weeks’ paid time off.
- After 8 years, you are entitled to one sabbatical of 8 weeks’ paid time off.
- Every 4 years afterward, you are entitled to one sabbatical of 8 weeks’ paid time off.

Leave requests for more than the designated allotments will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Sabbatical leave cannot be compounded with additional earned sabbatical leave or PTO, unless otherwise approved.

Sabbatical leave must be requested at least three months in advance, and is subject to approval based on several factors, some of which include:

- Dates requested and potential conflicts with other team members’ PTO
- The amount of PTO taken by the team member
- Upcoming projects and resourcing needs
- The team member’s performance

If we cannot, for whatever reason, allow sabbatical leave to be taken at the requested time, your manager and the Operations team will work with you to find a more suitable period for your leave. We will ensure that you get your sabbatical!

Sabbatical leave will be considered as a period of non-service when calculating year-end bonuses, and amounts will be prorated accordingly. All benefits which Fueled provides shall remain active while the team member is on sabbatical leave. All sabbatical leave taken will count toward the team member’s minimum PTO requirement, and recent sabbatical leave may cause future PTO requests to be denied.

### ***3.8 Extended Leave***

An extended leave is defined as an approved, unpaid absence from work for a specified period of time for reasons that do not fall under any protected statutory benefits. If a team member finds that they must be out of work for more than three days, they must contact their manager and the People Operations team to determine if an extended leave may be allowed.

A team member must provide at least 30 days' advance notice when the need for an extended leave is foreseeable. If it is not foreseeable, the team member must provide notice as soon as possible. Medical certifications and/or other documentation supporting the need for leave may be required. Requests for extended leave will be handled on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the company.

Extended leave will be considered as a period of non-service when calculating year-end bonuses, and amounts will be prorated accordingly. All extended leave taken will count toward the team member’s minimum PTO requirement, and recent extended leave may cause future PTO requests to be denied. Failure to return to work upon the expiration of the leave or refusing an offer of reinstatement in a similar role for which the team member is qualified will also result in voluntary termination of employment.

## 4.0 Perks and Benefits

### *4.1 End-of-Year Bonus*

At the end of each profitable year, Fueled’s full-time employees receive a bonus as a recognition of all of their hard work throughout the year. The amount of each team member’s bonus is calculated using a standard formula, which takes into account several factors. To start, the total amount of money allocated to the bonus pool for the entire company is a fixed percentage of EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization— essentially net income), meaning that the higher Fueled’s EBITDA, the more money will be allocated to the bonus pool!

The entire bonus pool is then apportioned to each department based on the relative size of each team, those team members’ base salaries, and the length of time that they’ve been with the company:

- Each new team members’ bonus allotment is prorated according to their start date within the calendar year
- Those with tenure over three years receive a 20% increase in their individual share of the pool

Finally, each Department Head divides their department’s allocation of the bonus pool amongst their team, taking into account the factors above as well as each team member’s performance and extended time off (Parental Leave, Sabbaticals, Unpaid Extended Leave) throughout the year.

Around Mid-February, each team member will be informed of their bonus amount by their manager, which will then be paid out at the end of March. You must still be employed by Fueled at the time of payment in order to receive the bonus.

### *4.2 Learning & Development Budget*

At Fueled, we encourage continuous learning in all forms, and each department manages a budget that supports diverse growth opportunities, from in person conferences to a good old-fashioned book. Each full-time team member also gets access to [LinkedIn Learning Hub](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/?u=140541538), an online learning platform which offers tens of thousands of courses that spur their personal and professional development.

The Learning & Development budget can be used toward the purchase of equipment, learning supplies, conferences, or anything else you feel will contribute to your professional development. The procedure for requesting a Fueled-sponsored L&D opportunity is as follows:

1. Approach your manager for sign-off; they must agree that your proposal is in the best interest of your personal growth and of the company *before* the purchase is made
2. If the request is in scope (i.e. within your department’s allocated budget), your manager may approve and must relay the approval to People Operations, who will track the expense(s) and provide any additional support needed
3. If the L&D request is out of scope, your manager must escalate to the Managing Director for further approval before signing off

Team members who are selected to attend a Fueled-sponsored conference such as WWDC or Google I/O will not be eligible for further L&D budget until the following year. Fueled reserves the right to deny expense requests related to L&D purchases that do not follow procedure.

### *4.3 Manager Petty Cash*

**Direct Report Petty Cash**

Each manager has an amount to use as petty cash per direct report per month. This is intended to be a small token of appreciation (gift card, meal delivery, etc.) This amount does not roll over/accrue. Each manager is responsible for taking initiative on this and keeping track of spend, but they are welcome to enlist the help of Operations Managers or Coordinators to make purchases/send items as needed (especially so that using personal funds is not required).

The detailed amounts per locations are:

- US: $25
- UK: £20
- India: ₹1,800
- Europe: €23
- Russia: 1,800 ₽
- Remote: $20
- Canada: C$30

**New Hire Lunch**

Each manager can take a new hire in their department out to lunch (in person or virtual) for their first day/week. Per person amount:

- US: $20
- Canada: C$24
- UK: £15
- Noida: ₹1500
- Russia: ₽1500
- Europe: €16
- Remote: $15 (South America, Lebanon)

**Quarterly Meals**

Each Department Head is encouraged to coordinate quarterly outings for their team (in person or virtual). Per person per quarter amount:

- US: $95
- Canada: C$80
- UK: £80
- Noida: ₹2000
- Russia: $40
- Europe: €50
- Remote: $40 (South America, Lebanon)

### *4.4 P&P Stipend*

Each team member can expense the following amount for a meal if they are remote during a P&P presentation. Per person amount:

- US: $20
- Canada: C$22
- UK: £20
- Noida: ₹1000
- Russia: ₽1000
- Europe: €15
- Remote: $15 (South America, Lebanon)

### *4.5 Project Completion Recognition*

The Project Management team has a budget to send Project Completion Recognition gifts to team members. Once a project has been completed, the Project Manager can make a copy of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EdhEiCjfsYCMPHqhyfkyIrdiMjQtUz0H6CJ9McfCSkA/edit#gid=0), fill it out, and send it to Lisa Kerner, and a member of the Operations team will coordinate the gifts. Budget is based on the duration of the project, as outlined in the spreadsheet.

### *4.6 Anniversary Gifts*

Every full-time team member at Fueled receives a gift each year on the anniversary of their start date with Fueled. The budget for this is $500—we typically try to surprise you with something we know you’ll love, but we’re also happy to take suggestions!

### *4.7 Employee Referral Bonuses*

Fueled strongly encourages our team members to participate in the recruiting process by referring potential candidates to the Talent team. Many studies have shown that referral programs significantly improve the quality of new hires, team morale, retention, and company profitability.

Team members are eligible to receive a referral bonus if the candidate is hired to a full-time position; this bonus is paid out once the referred team member has completed four months of employment. You must still be employed by Fueled at this point in order to receive the bonus.

The amount of the referral bonus is generally dependent upon the [tier level](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ip2dOjh5lPOwNj_DGT_uUqPaY-ksTcT-d5J0tadLIiw/edit?usp=sharing) of the referred team member, as shown below (but please see the DE&I Initiative section for exceptions):

| Tier | Bonus Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Level 4 | $5,000 |
| Level 3 | $4,000 |
| Level 2 | $3,000 |
| Level 1 | $1,000 |

**Fueled’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) Initiative**

As part of our ongoing efforts to increase diversity at all levels and within all departments of the company, Fueled aims to increase our pipeline of candidates from groups who are statistically underrepresented in tech.

Studies have shown that standard referral bonus programs often lead to continued homogeneity, as team members typically refer people who are similar to themselves. As we are committed to increasing our diversity of skills, thought, and experience, it’s necessary for us to increase our representation from these underrepresented groups.

To that end, we are encouraging the team to refer candidates from underrepresented groups. The amount of the referral bonus for these candidates is $5,000 for all tier levels and only depends on the department. Please see the chart below for a breakdown:

| Department | Underrepresented Groups |
| --- | --- |
| Design, Mobile, Product, Web | Women and people who identify as Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Middle Eastern, Native American, or Native Hawaiian & Other Pacific Islander |
| Marketing, New Projects, Operations, Project Management, QA | People who identify as Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Middle Eastern, Native American, or Native Hawaiian & Other Pacific Islander |

Please refer to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10P8qc1UpR2t8FGOZPkqv0_EMblSr0O2YbEdfvdkQCdM/edit?usp=sharing) for more information and logistics around submitting your referrals.

### *4.8 Client Referral Bonuses*

Fueled team members are eligible to receive a commission on any project they bring to Fueled in the amount of 5% of total billings received during the first year (12 months) of business, granted the client has not previously engaged with Fueled and has not been in communication with Fueled in the last three years, prior to the introduction from the team member.

**Mechanics**

- This amount is paid out quarterly on work paid up to date. In other words, commission is on cash received, not total invoiced amount.
- The first year of client engagement begins from the time of the first date of time being tracked.
- The commission is calculated on money received in the quarter, on total invoices created in the 12-month period. Commission can be paid out for up to 18 months from the time of the first invoice.

**Other Notes**

- Non-team members receive a flat 3.5% commission.
- If a team member departs Fueled, their commission rate drops to 3.5% for any work performed after their last day.

## 5.0 Performance, Discipline, and Departures

### *5.1 Grievances and Escalation*

It is our policy to ensure that all employees have access to a procedure to help deal with any grievances relating to their employment, fairly and without unreasonable delay. We aim to investigate any formal grievance raised, hold a meeting to discuss it with you, inform you in writing of the outcome, and give you a right of appeal if you are not satisfied. This procedure applies to all employees regardless of length of service. This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.

Issues that could cause grievances may include:

1. terms and conditions of employment;
2. health and safety;
3. work relations;
4. bullying and harassment;
5. new working practices;
6. working environment;
7. organizational change; and
8. discrimination.

This Grievance Procedure should not be used to complain about termination or disciplinary action—if you are dissatisfied with any disciplinary action, you should submit an appeal under the appropriate procedure. We have a separate Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy that may be useful if you have been the victim of bullying or harassment or wish to report an incident of bullying or harassment involving other people. We also operate a separate Whistleblowing Policy to enable employees to report illegal activities, wrongdoing, or malpractice. However, where you are directly affected by the matter in question, or where you feel you have been victimized for an act of whistleblowing, you may raise the matter under this Grievance Procedure.

If you have difficulty at any stage of the Grievance Procedure because of a disability or because English is not your first language, you should discuss the situation with your manager as soon as possible. Written grievances will be placed on your personnel file along with a record of any decisions taken and any notes or other documents compiled during the grievance process.

**Raising Grievances Informally**

Most grievances can be resolved quickly and informally through discussion with your manager. If you feel unable to speak to your manager, for example, because the complaint concerns them, then you should speak informally to your department head, People Operations or subsequently the Managing Director. If this does not resolve the issue, you should follow the formal procedure below.

**Formal Written Grievances**

If your grievance cannot be resolved informally, you should put it in writing and submit it to your manager, indicating that it is a formal grievance. If the grievance concerns your manager, you may submit it to your department head, People Operations, or finally the Managing Director instead. The written grievance should contain a brief description of the nature of your complaint, including any relevant facts, dates, and names of individuals involved. In some situations we may ask you to provide further information.

**Investigations**

It may be necessary for us to carry out an investigation into your grievance. The amount of any investigation required will depend on the nature of the allegations and will vary from case to case. It may involve interviewing and taking statements from you and any witnesses, and/or reviewing relevant documents. You must cooperate fully and promptly in any investigation. This may include informing us of the names of any relevant witnesses, disclosing any relevant documents to us, and attending interviews as part of our investigation. We may initiate an investigation before holding a grievance meeting where we consider this appropriate. In other cases we may hold a grievance meeting before deciding what investigation (if any) to carry out. In those cases we will hold a further grievance meeting with you after our investigation and before we reach a decision.

**Grievance Meetings**

We will arrange a grievance meeting within a reasonable period following receipt of your written grievance. The purpose of a grievance meeting is to enable you to explain your grievance and how you think it should be resolved, and to assist us to reach a decision based on the available evidence and the representations you have made. After an initial grievance meeting we may carry out further investigations and hold further grievance meetings as we consider appropriate. Such meetings will be arranged without unreasonable delay. We will write to you within a reasonable period following the final grievance meeting to inform you of the outcome of your grievance and any further action that we intend to take to resolve the grievance. We will also remind you of your right of appeal. Where appropriate we may hold a meeting to give you this information in person.

### *5.2 Performance Assessments*

It is our policy to ensure that concerns over performance are dealt with fairly and that steps are taken to establish the facts and to give employees the opportunity to respond at a hearing before any formal action is taken. This policy does not apply to cases involving genuine sickness absence or misconduct. In those cases reference should be made to the respective policies or procedures in the Handbook. This procedure applies to all team members, regardless of length of service. This procedure does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and it may be amended at any time.

**Identifying Performance Issues**

In the first instance, performance issues should normally be dealt with informally between you and your manager as part of day-to-day management. Where appropriate, a note of any such informal discussions may be placed on your personnel file but will be ignored for the purposes of any future capability hearings. The formal procedure should be used for more serious cases, or in any case where an earlier informal discussion has not resulted in a satisfactory improvement. Informal discussions may help:

1. clarify the required standards;
2. identify areas of concern;
3. establish the likely causes of poor performance and identify any training needs; and/or
4. set targets for improvement and a time-scale for review.

Employees will not normally be dismissed for performance reasons without previous warnings. However, in serious cases of gross negligence, or in any case involving an employee who is in their first 6 months of employment, termination without previous warnings may be appropriate.

If we have concerns about your performance, we will undertake an assessment to decide if there are grounds for taking formal action under this procedure. The procedure involved will depend on the circumstances but may involve reviewing your personnel file including any appraisal records, gathering any relevant documents, monitoring your work and, if appropriate, interviewing you and/or collecting peer feedback regarding your work.

**Disabilities**

Consideration will be given to whether poor performance may be related to a disability and, if so, whether there are reasonable adjustments that could be made to your working arrangements, including changing your duties or providing additional equipment or training. We may also consider making adjustments to this procedure in appropriate cases. If you wish to discuss this or inform us of any medical condition(s) you consider relevant, you should contact your manager or People Operations.

**Notification of a Performance Assessment**

If we consider that there are grounds for taking formal action over alleged poor performance, you will be required to attend a performance assessment. We will notify you in writing of our concerns over your performance, the reasons for those concerns, and the likely outcome if we decide after the hearing that your performance has been unsatisfactory. We will also include the following where appropriate:

1. A summary of relevant information gathered as part of any investigation.
2. A copy of any relevant documents which will be used at the capability hearing.
3. A copy of any relevant witness statements, except where a witness's identity is to be kept confidential, in which case we will give you as much information as possible while maintaining confidentiality.

We will give you written notice of the date, time and place of the performance assessment. The hearing will be held as soon as reasonably practicable, but you will be given a reasonable amount of time to prepare your case based on the information we have given you.

**Procedure for a Performance Assessment**

The aims of a performance-related hearing will usually include:

1. Setting out the required standards that we believe you may have failed to meet, and going through any relevant evidence that we have gathered.
2. Allowing you to ask questions, present evidence, call witnesses, respond to evidence and make representations.
3. Establishing the likely causes of poor performance including any reasons why any measures taken so far have not led to the required improvement.
4. Identifying whether there are further measures, such as additional training or supervision, which may improve performance.
5. Where appropriate, discussing targets for improvement and a time-scale for review.
6. If dismissal is a possibility, establishing whether there is any likelihood of a significant improvement being made within a reasonable time and whether there is any practical alternative to termination, such as redeployment.

**Stage 1: Written Notice**

Following a Stage 1 performance hearing, if we decide that your performance is unsatisfactory, we will give you a written notice, setting out:

1. the areas in which you have not met the required performance standards;
2. targets for improvement;
3. any measures, such as additional training or supervision, which will be taken with a view to improving performance;
4. a period for review; and/or
5. the consequences of failing to improve within the review period, or of further unsatisfactory performance.

The written notice will usually remain active for six months from the end of the review period, but this may change depending on various circumstances. After the active period the note will remain permanently on your personnel file but will be disregarded in deciding the outcome of any future proceedings.

Your performance will be monitored during the review period and we will write to inform you of the outcome:

1. If your manager is satisfied with your performance, no further action will be taken.
2. If your manager is not satisfied, the matter may be progressed to Stage 2.
3. If your manager feels that there has been a substantial but insufficient improvement, the review period may be extended.

**Stage 2: Final Written Warning**

If your performance does not improve within the review period set out in your written notice, or if there is further evidence of poor performance while your notice is still active, we may decide to proceed to Stage 2 hearing. We will send you written notification of this.

If we decide that your performance is unsatisfactory after your Stage 2 hearing, we will give you a final written warning, setting out:

1. the areas in which you have not met the required performance standards;
2. targets for improvement;
3. any measures, such as additional training or supervision, which will be taken with a view to improving performance;
4. a period for review; and
5. the consequences of failing to improve within the review period, or of further unsatisfactory performance.

A final written warning will normally remain active for twelve months from the end of the review period. After the active period, the warning will remain permanently on your personnel file but will be disregarded in deciding the outcome of future capability proceedings.

Your performance will be monitored during the review period and we will write to inform you of the outcome:

1. If your manager is satisfied with your performance, no further action will be taken.
2. If your manager is not satisfied, the matter may be progressed to Stage 3.
3. If your manager feels that there has been a substantial but insufficient improvement, the review period may be extended.

**Stage 3: Termination or Redeployment**

We may decide to hold a Stage 3 hearing if we have reason to believe:

1. your performance has not improved sufficiently within the review period set out in a final written warning;
2. your performance is unsatisfactory while a final written warning is still active; or
3. your performance has been grossly negligent such as to warrant dismissal without the need for a final written warning.

We will send you a written notification of the hearing.

Following the hearing, if we find that your performance is unsatisfactory, we may consider a range of options including:

1. termination;
2. redeploying you into another suitable job at the same or a lower grade;
3. extending an active final written warning and setting a further review period (in exceptional cases where we believe a substantial improvement is likely within the review period); or
4. giving a final written warning (where no final written warning is currently active).

Termination will normally be with full notice or payment in lieu of notice, unless your performance has been so negligent as to amount to gross misconduct, in which case we may dismiss you without notice or any payment in lieu of.

### *5.3 Disciplinary Rules & Procedure*

The aim of the Disciplinary Rules and Disciplinary Procedure is to set out the standards of conduct expected of all team members and to provide a framework within which managers can work with staff to maintain those standards and encourage improvement where necessary. We may amend our Disciplinary Rules at any time and it is your duty to ensure that you are up to date on procedure changes.

**Rules of Conduct**

While working for us you should at all times maintain professional and responsible standards of conduct. In particular you should:

1. observe the terms and conditions of your contract, particularly with regard to:
    1. hours of work; and
    2. confidentiality.
2. observe all of the policies, procedures, and regulations included in the Handbook or notified to you from time to time;
3. take reasonable care in respect of the health and safety of colleagues and third parties;
4. comply with all reasonable instructions given by managers; and
5. act at all times in good faith and in the best interests of our business, customers and team members.

Failure to maintain satisfactory standards of conduct may result in action being taken under our Disciplinary Procedure, detailed below. If you are in any doubt as to your responsibilities or the standards of conduct expected, you should speak to your manager.

**Misconduct**

The following are examples of matters that will normally be regarded as misconduct and will be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure:

1. minor breaches of our policies;
2. minor breaches of your contract;
3. damage to, or unauthorised use of, our property;
4. poor timekeeping or time wasting;
5. unauthorised absence from work;
6. refusal to follow instructions;
7. excessive personal email or internet usage;
8. obscene language or other offensive behavior;
9. negligence in the performance of your duties;

This list is intended as a guide and is not exhaustive.

**Gross Misconduct**

Gross misconduct is a serious breach of contract and includes misconduct which, in our opinion, is likely to prejudice our business or reputation or irreparably damage the working relationship and trust between us. Gross misconduct will be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure and will normally lead to termination without notice or pay in lieu of notice.

The following are examples of matters that are normally regarded as gross misconduct:

1. theft, or unauthorised removal of our property or the property of a colleague, contractor, customer or member of the public;
2. fraud, forgery or other dishonesty, including fabrication of expense claims and time sheets;
3. actual or threatened violence, or behavior which provokes violence;
4. deliberate damage to our buildings, fittings, property or equipment, or the property of a colleague, contractor, customer or member of the public;
5. serious misuse of our property or name;
6. deliberately accessing internet sites containing pornographic, offensive or obscene material;
7. serious insubordination;
8. repeated or serious failure to obey instructions, or any other serious act of insubordination;
9. unlawful discrimination or harassment;
10. bringing the organization into serious disrepute;
11. being under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or other substances while performing serious work tasks;
12. causing loss, damage or injury through serious negligence;

16. conviction for a criminal offence that, in our opinion, may affect our reputation or our relationships with our employees, customers, or the public, or otherwise affects your suitability to continue to work for us;
17. possession, use, supply or attempted supply of illegal drugs;
18. serious neglect of duties, or a serious or deliberate breach of your contract or operating procedures;
19. knowing breach of statutory rules affecting your work;
20. unauthorised use, processing or disclosure of personal data contrary to our Data Protection Policy;
21. harassment of or discrimination against employees, contractors, clients or members of the public, whether related to gender, marital or civil partner status, gender reassignment or identity, sex, sexual orientation, race, color, nationality, ethnic or national origin, disability, religion or beliefs, or age;
22. refusal to disclose any of the information required by your employment or any other information that may have a bearing on the performance of your duties;
23. giving false information as to qualifications or entitlement to work (including immigration status) in order to gain employment or other benefits;
24. knowingly taking parental, paternity or adoption leave when not eligible to do so or for a purpose other than supporting a child;
25. making a disclosure of false or misleading information under our Whistleblowing Policy maliciously, for personal gain, or otherwise in bad faith;
26. making untrue allegations in bad faith against a colleague;
27. victimizing a colleague who has raised concerns, made a complaint, or given evidence or information under our Whistleblowing Policy, Anti-Corruption and Bribery policy, Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy, Grievance Procedure, Disciplinary Procedure or otherwise;
28. serious misuse of our information technology systems (including misuse of developed or licensed software, use of unauthorized software and misuse of email and the internet);
29. undertaking unauthorised paid or unpaid employment during your working hours;
30. unauthorised entry into an area of the premises to which access is prohibited.

This list is intended as a guide and is not exhaustive.

***Disciplinary Procedure***

It is our policy to ensure that all disciplinary matters are dealt with fairly and that steps are taken to establish the facts and to give employees the opportunity to respond before taking any formal action.

This procedure applies to all employees regardless of length of service, and is used to deal with misconduct. It does not apply to cases involving genuine sickness absence, poor performance, or proposed redundancies/layoffs. This procedure does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and it may be amended at any time. We may also vary this procedure, including any time limits, as appropriate in any case.

**Minor Conduct Issues**

Minor conduct issues can and should often be resolved informally between you and your manager. These discussions should be held in private and without undue delay whenever there is cause for concern. Where appropriate, a note of any such informal discussions may be placed on your personnel file but will be ignored for the purposes of any future disciplinary hearings. In some cases an informal verbal warning may be given, which will not form part of your disciplinary records. Formal steps will be taken under this procedure if the matter is not resolved, or if informal discussion is not appropriate (for example, because of the seriousness of the allegation). If you have difficulty at any stage of this procedure because of a disability, you should discuss the situation with People Operations as soon as possible.

**Investigations**

The purpose of an investigation is for us to establish a fair and balanced view of the facts relating to any disciplinary allegations against you, before deciding whether to proceed with a disciplinary hearing. The amount of investigation required will depend on the nature of the allegations and will vary from case to case. It may involve interviewing and taking statements from you and any witnesses, and/or reviewing relevant documents. Investigative interviews are solely for the purpose of fact-finding and no decision on disciplinary action will be taken until after a disciplinary hearing has been held.

You do not normally have the right to bring a companion to an investigative interview. However, we may allow you to bring a companion if it helps you to overcome any disability, or any difficulty in understanding English. You must cooperate fully and promptly in any investigation. This will include informing us of the names of any relevant witnesses, disclosing any relevant documents to us and attending investigative interviews if required.

**Criminal Allegations**

If your conduct is the subject of a criminal investigation, charge or conviction we will investigate the facts before deciding whether to take formal disciplinary action. We will not usually wait for the outcome of any prosecution before deciding what action, if any, to take. Where you are unable or have been advised not to attend a disciplinary hearing or say anything about a pending criminal matter, we may have to make a decision based on the available evidence. A criminal investigation, charge or conviction relating to conduct outside work may be treated as a disciplinary matter if we consider that it is relevant to your employment. This process is independent of any other legal action to which you may be subjected.

**Suspension**

In some circumstances, we may need to suspend you from work. The suspension will be for no longer than is necessary to investigate the allegations and we will confirm the arrangements to you in writing. While suspended, you should not visit our premises or contact any of our clients, customers, suppliers, contractors or team members, unless you have been authorized to do so by People Operations. Suspension of this kind is not a disciplinary penalty and does not imply that any decision has already been made about the allegations. Pay and benefits during suspension will be calculated as set out in your contract. Failure to respect a suspension will be considered gross misconduct and may be grounds for further discipline, up to and including termination.

**Notification of a Hearing**

Following any investigation, if we consider there are grounds for disciplinary action, you will be required to attend a disciplinary hearing. We will inform you in writing of the allegations against you, the basis for those allegations, and what the likely range of consequences will be if we decide after the hearing that the allegations are true. We will also include the following where appropriate:

1. a summary of relevant information gathered during the investigation;
2. a copy of any relevant documents which will be used at the disciplinary hearing; and/or
3. a copy of any relevant witness statements, except where a witness's identity is to be kept confidential, in which case we will give you as much information as possible while maintaining confidentiality.

We will give you written notice of the date, time and place of the disciplinary hearing. The hearing will be held as soon as reasonably practicable, but you will be given a reasonable amount of time to prepare your case based on the information we have given you.

**Disciplinary Penalties**

The usual penalties for misconduct are set out below. No penalty should be imposed without a hearing. We aim to treat all employees fairly and consistently, and a penalty imposed on another employee for similar misconduct will usually be taken into account but should not be treated as a precedent; each case will be assessed on its own merits. You will not normally be terminated for a first act of misconduct, unless we decide it amounts to gross misconduct or you are in your first six months of employment.

**Stage 1 - First Written Warning**

It will usually be appropriate for a first act of misconduct where there are no other active written warnings on your disciplinary record.

**Stage 2 - Final Written Warning**

It will usually be appropriate for:

1. misconduct where there is already an active written warning on your record; or
2. misconduct that we consider sufficiently serious to warrant a final written warning, even though there are no other active warnings on your record.

**Stage 3 - Termination**

It will usually only be appropriate for:

1. any misconduct during your first six months of employment (although we reserve the right not to follow this process in the first two years of your employment);
2. further misconduct where there is an active final written warning on your record; or
3. any gross misconduct regardless of whether there are active warnings on your record. Gross misconduct will usually result in immediate dismissal without notice or payment in lieu of notice. Examples of gross misconduct are set out in our Disciplinary Rules.

**Alternatives to Termination**

In some cases, we may, at our discretion, consider alternatives to termination. These will usually be accompanied by a final written warning. Examples include:

1. demotion;
2. transfer to another department or job;
3. a period of suspension without pay;
4. reduction in pay;
5. loss of future pay increment or bonus; and/or
6. loss of overtime.

**The Effect of a Warning**

Written warnings will set out the nature of the misconduct, the change in behavior required, the period for which the warning will remain active, and the likely consequences of further misconduct in that active period. A first written warning will usually remain active for six months and a final written warning will usually remain active for twelve months. Your conduct may be reviewed at the end of a warning's active period and if it has not improved sufficiently we may decide to extend the active period. After the active period, the warning will remain permanently on your personnel file but will be disregarded in deciding the outcome of future disciplinary proceedings.

### *5.4 Other Terminations*

Where a termination takes place which is not related to a team member’s conduct, performance, or capability, a written statement will be provided, a meeting will be held and an appeal hearing offered. An example of non-disciplinary terminations would be in the event that a change or diminishing of Fueled’s service offering renders an employee or employees redundant and transfers to other roles or departments are not possible from a business standpoint. In these cases, a written statement will set out the reason or reasons why it is intended to end the employment.

### *5.5 Exit Interviews*

You may be asked to participate in an exit interview before your departure from Fueled. The purpose of the exit interview is to provide management with greater insight into team member relations, to avoid unnecessary team member claims, and to gather feedback for improvement. Your cooperation in the exit interview process is appreciated, but not required. All feedback given in the exit interview will be withheld from the relevant parties until after your last day.

### *5.6 About Hearings & Meetings*

The following policies and procedures are relevant to hearings related to:

1. returning from an extended sick leave;
2. performance issues;
3. misconduct and gross misconduct; and
4. grievances.

**Right to be Accompanied**

You may bring a companion to any meeting or appeal meeting under these procedures. This person may be a colleague or a trade union representative. Their details must be given to the manager conducting the meeting, in good time before it takes place. Employees are allowed reasonable time off from duties without loss of pay to act as a companion. However, they are not obliged to act as a companion and may decline a request if they so wish. We may at our discretion permit other companions (for example, a family member) where this will help overcome particular difficulties caused by a disability, or difficulty understanding English.

A companion may make representations, ask questions, and sum up your position, but will not be allowed to answer questions on your behalf. You may confer privately with your companion at any time during a meeting.

**Hearing Procedures**

If you or your companion cannot attend a hearing, you should inform us immediately and we will usually arrange an alternative time. You must make every effort to attend a hearing, and failure to attend without good reason may be treated as misconduct. If you fail to attend without good reason, or are persistently unable to do so (for example, for health reasons), we may have to make a decision based on the available evidence including any written representations you have made.

A hearing will normally be held by your manager or department head. People Operations and/or the Managing Director may also be in attendance. You may ask relevant witnesses to appear at a hearing, provided you give us sufficient advance notice to arrange their attendance. You will be given the opportunity to respond to any information given by a witness. However, you will not normally be permitted to cross-examine witnesses unless, in exceptional circumstances, we decide that a fair hearing could not be held otherwise.

A hearing may be adjourned if we need to gather any further information or give consideration to matters discussed at the hearing. You will be given a reasonable opportunity to consider any new information obtained before the hearing is reconvened. We will inform you in writing of our decision and our reasons for it, within a reasonable period following the capability hearing. Where possible we will also explain this information to you in person.

**Appeals**

You may appeal against the outcome of any stage of these procedures and you may bring a companion to an appeal meeting. An appeal should be made in writing, stating the full grounds of appeal, to your manager, People Operations, and/or the Managing Director within seven days of the date on which the decision was sent to you. Unless it is not practicable, you will be given written notice of an appeal meeting within one week of the meeting. In cases of dismissal, the appeal will be held as soon as possible.

Any new matters raised in an appeal may delay an appeal meeting if further investigation is required. You will be provided with written details of any new information which comes to light before an appeal meeting. You will also be given a reasonable opportunity to consider this information before the meeting. A hearing may also be adjourned if we need to gather any further information or give consideration to matters discussed at the hearing. You will be given a reasonable opportunity to consider any new information obtained before the hearing is reconvened.

Where practicable, an appeal meeting will be conducted by a manager who is senior to the individual who conducted the meeting, up to and including the Managing Director. People Operations will also usually be present. Depending on the circumstances, an appeal meeting may be a complete rehearing of the matter or a review of the original decision. The final decision will be confirmed in writing, if possible within one week of the appeal meeting. There will be no further right of appeal.

The date that any dismissal takes effect will not be delayed pending the outcome of an appeal. However, if the appeal is successful, the decision to dismiss will be revoked with no loss of continuity or pay.

Following the appeal hearing we may:

1. confirm the original decision;
2. revoke the original decision; or
3. substitute a different penalty.

We will inform you in writing of our final decision as soon as possible. Where possible we will also explain this to you in person. There will be no further right of appeal.

**Confidentiality**

Our aim is to deal with these matters sensitively and with due respect for the privacy of any individuals involved. All employees must treat as confidential any information communicated to them in connection with a matter which is subject to these procedures. You, and anyone accompanying you (including witnesses), must not make electronic recordings of any meetings or hearings conducted under these procedures. You will normally be told the names of any witnesses whose evidence is relevant to your hearing, unless we believe that a witness's identity should remain confidential.

## 6.0 Employment Policies

### *6.1 Code of Ethics*

Fueled will conduct its business honestly and ethically wherever operations are maintained. We strive to improve the quality of our services, products, and operations and will maintain a reputation for honesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, integrity, trust, and sound business judgment. Our managers and team members are expected to adhere to high standards of business and personal integrity as a representation of our business practices.

We expect that officers, directors, and team members will not knowingly misrepresent Fueled and will not speak on behalf of the company unless specifically authorized. The confidentiality of trade secrets, proprietary information, and similar confidential commercially-sensitive information (i.e. financial or sales records/reports, marketing or business strategies/plans, product development, customer lists, patents, trademarks, etc.) about Fueled or its operations, or that of our customers or partners, is to be treated with discretion and only be disseminated on a need-to-know basis (see policies relating to privacy).

Violation of the Code of Ethics can result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment. The degree of discipline imposed may be influenced by the existence of voluntary disclosure of any ethical violation and whether or not the violator cooperated in any subsequent investigation.

### *6.2 Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment*

***Equal Opportunity Statement***

Fueled Limited is committed to promoting equal opportunities in employment. You and any job applicants will receive equal treatment regardless of age, race, color, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, sex, pregnancy (including childbirth, lactation and related medical conditions), physical or mental disability, genetic information (including testing and characteristics), veteran status, uniformed service member status, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local laws (**Protected Characteristics**). We are dedicated to the fulfillment of this policy in regard to all aspects of employment for every team member, including but not limited to recruiting, hiring, placement, transfer, training, promotion, rates of pay and other compensation, conduct at work, disciplinary and grievance procedures, termination, and all other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.

**Discrimination**

You must not unlawfully discriminate against or harass other people, including current and former employees, job applicants, clients, customers, suppliers and visitors. This applies in the workplace, outside the workplace (when dealing with customers, suppliers or other work-related contacts), and on work-related trips or events including social events.

The following forms of discrimination are prohibited under this policy and are unlawful:

1. **Direct discrimination:** treating someone less favorably because of a Protected Characteristic. For example, rejecting a job applicant because of their religious views or because they might be of a different sexual orientation.
2. **Indirect discrimination:** a provision, criterion or practice that applies to everyone but adversely affects people with a particular Protected Characteristic more than others, and is not justified. For example, requiring a job to be done full-time rather than part-time would adversely affect single parents because they generally have greater childcare commitments. Such a requirement would be discriminatory unless it can be justified.
3. **Harassment:** this includes sexual harassment and other unwanted conduct related to a Protected Characteristic, which has the purpose or effect of violating someone's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. Harassment is dealt with further in our Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy.
4. **Victimization:** retaliation against someone who has complained or has supported someone else's complaint about discrimination or harassment.
5. **Disability discrimination:** this includes direct and indirect discrimination, any unjustified less-favorable treatment because of the effects of a disability, and/or failure to make reasonable adjustments to alleviate disadvantages caused by a disability.

**Recruiting**

Recruitment, promotions, and other selection exercises such as redundancy selection will be conducted on the basis of merit, against objective criteria that avoid discrimination. Shortlisting will be done by more than one person and with the involvement of People Operations, where possible. Our recruitment procedures are reviewed regularly to ensure that individuals are treated on the basis of their relevant merits and abilities.

We take steps to ensure that our vacancies are advertised to a diverse labour market, with advertisements which avoid stereotyping or using wording that may discourage particular groups from applying. Job applicants will also not be asked questions which might suggest an intention to discriminate on grounds of a Protected Characteristic, nor will they be asked about health or disability before a job offer is made. There are limited exceptions which should only be used with the approval of People Operations. For example:

1. Questions necessary to establish if an applicant can perform an intrinsic part of the job (subject to any reasonable adjustments).
2. Questions to establish if an applicant is fit to attend an assessment or any reasonable adjustments that may be needed at interview or assessment.
3. Positive action to recruit disabled persons.
4. Equal opportunities monitoring (which will not form part of the selection or decision-making process).

Where necessary, job offers can be made conditional on a satisfactory medical check.

To ensure that this policy is operating effectively, and to identify groups that may be underrepresented or disadvantaged in our organisation, we may monitor applicants' ethnic group, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion and age as part of the recruitment procedure. Provision of this information is voluntary and it will not adversely affect an individual's chances of recruitment or any other decision related to their employment. The information is removed from applications before shortlisting, and kept in an anonymized format solely for the purposes stated in this policy. Analysing this data helps us take appropriate steps to avoid discrimination and improve equality and diversity.

**Training, Promotion, and Conditions of Service**

Training needs will be identified through regular appraisals. You will be given appropriate access to training to enable you to progress within the organization and all promotion decisions will be made on the basis of merit.

Our conditions of service, benefits and facilities are reviewed regularly to ensure that they are available to all of you who should have access to them and that there are no unlawful obstacles to accessing them.

**Termination of Employment**

We will ensure that redundancy criteria and procedures are fair and objective and are not directly or indirectly discriminatory. We will also ensure that disciplinary procedures and penalties are applied without discrimination, whether they result in disciplinary warnings, dismissal or other disciplinary action.

**Disabilities**

If you are disabled or become disabled, we encourage you to tell us about your condition so that we can support you as is appropriate. If you experience difficulties at work because of your disability, you may wish to contact People Operations to discuss any reasonable adjustments that would help overcome or minimize the difficulty. People Operations may wish to consult with you and your medical adviser about possible adjustments. We will consider the matter carefully and try to accommodate your needs within reason. If we consider a particular adjustment would not be reasonable we will explain our reasons and try to find an alternative solution where possible. We will monitor the physical features of our premises to consider whether they might place anyone with a disability at a substantial disadvantage. Where necessary, we will take reasonable steps to improve access.

**Employment Types**

Part-time and fixed-term staff should be treated the same as comparable full-time or permanent staff and will enjoy no less favorable terms and conditions (on a pro-rata basis where appropriate), unless different treatment is justified.

**Breaches of this Policy**

We take a strict approach to breaches of this policy, which will be dealt with in accordance with our Disciplinary Procedure. Serious cases of deliberate discrimination may amount to gross misconduct, resulting in dismissal. If you believe that you have suffered discrimination, you can raise the matter through our Grievance Procedure or through our Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy as appropriate. Complaints will be treated in confidence and investigated as appropriate.

There must also be no victimization or retaliation against staff who complain about discrimination. However, making a false allegation deliberately and in bad faith will be treated as misconduct and dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure.

This policy is supported by the following other policies and procedures:

1. Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy.
2. Grievance Procedure.
3. Disciplinary Procedure.
4. Flexible Working Procedure.
5. Maternity, Paternity, Adoption and Shared Parental Leave Policies.

***Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy***

Fueled is committed to providing a working environment free from harassment and bullying, and ensuring all staff are treated, and treat others, with dignity and respect. This policy covers harassment or bullying for all employees, officers, consultants, contractors, volunteers, interns, casual workers and agency workers which occurs either at work or out of the workplace, such as on business trips or at work-related events or social functions. It covers bullying and harassment by staff (which may include consultants, contractors and agency workers) and also by third parties such as customers, suppliers or visitors to our premises. This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.

**Who is Responsible for this Policy?**

All managers have a specific responsibility to operate within the boundaries of this policy, ensure that their direct reports understand the standards of behavior expected of them, and to take action when behavior falls below its requirements. All employees should disclose any instances of harassment or bullying of which they become aware to their manager, their department head, People Operations, or the Managing Director. Questions about this policy and requests for training or information on dealing with bullying or harassment should be directed to People Operations.

**What is Harassment?**

Harassment is any unwanted physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct that has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. A single incident can amount to harassment. It also includes treating someone less favorably because they have submitted or refused to submit to such behavior in the past. Unlawful harassment may involve conduct of a sexual nature (sexual harassment), or it may be related to age, disability, gender reassignment, marital or civil partner status, pregnancy or maternity, race, color, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation. Harassment is unacceptable even if it does not fall within any of these categories.

Harassment may include, for example:

1. unwanted physical conduct or "horseplay", including touching, pinching, pushing and grabbing;
2. continued suggestions for social activity after it has been made clear that such suggestions are unwelcome;
3. sending or displaying material that is pornographic or that some people may find offensive (including emails, text messages, video clips and images sent by mobile phone or posted on the internet);
4. unwelcome sexual advances or suggestive behavior (which the harasser may perceive as harmless);
5. racist, sexist, homophobic or ageist jokes, or derogatory or stereotypical remarks about a particular ethnic or religious group or gender;
6. outing or threatening to out someone as gay, lesbian, queer, transgender, or any other sexual identity or orientation;
7. offensive emails, text messages or social media content; or
8. mocking, mimicking or belittling a person's disability.

A person may be harassed even if they were not the intended "target". For example, a person may be harassed by racist jokes about a different ethnic group if the jokes create an offensive environment.

**What is Bullying?**

Bullying is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour involving the misuse of power that can make a person feel vulnerable, upset, humiliated, undermined, or threatened. Power does not always mean being in a position of authority, but can include both personal strength and the power to coerce through fear or intimidation. Bullying can take the form of physical, verbal, and non-verbal conduct. Bullying may include, by way of example:

1. physical or psychological threats;
2. overbearing and intimidating levels of supervision;
3. inappropriate derogatory remarks about someone's performance.

Legitimate, reasonable, and constructive criticism of a worker's performance or behavior, or reasonable instructions given to workers in the course of their employment, will not amount to bullying on their own.

**Being Harassed or Bullied: Informal Steps**

If you are being harassed or bullied, consider whether you feel able to raise the problem informally with the person responsible. You should explain clearly to them that their behavior is not welcome or makes you uncomfortable. If this is too difficult or embarrassing, you should speak to People Operations, who can provide confidential advice and assistance in resolving the issue, either formally or informally. If you are not certain whether an incident or series of incidents amounts to bullying or harassment, you should initially contact People Operations informally for confidential advice. If informal steps are not appropriate or have been unsuccessful, you should follow the formal procedure set out below and/or refer to our Grievance Procedure.

**Raising a Formal Complaint**

If you wish to make a formal complaint about bullying or harassment, you should submit it in writing to People Operations, whose role is to achieve a solution wherever possible and to respect the confidentiality of all concerned. Your written complaint should set out full details of the conduct in question, including the name of the harasser or bully, the nature of the harassment or bullying, the date(s) and time(s) at which it occurred, the names of any witnesses and any action that has been taken so far to attempt to stop it from occurring. As a general principle, the decision whether to progress a complaint is up to you. However, we have a duty to protect all staff and may pursue the matter independently if, in all the circumstances, we consider it appropriate to do so.

**Formal Investigations**

We will investigate complaints in a timely and confidential manner. Individuals not involved in the complaint or the investigation should not be told about it. The investigation will be conducted by someone with appropriate experience and no prior involvement in the complaint, and the investigation will be thorough, impartial and objective, and carried out with sensitivity and due respect for the rights of all parties concerned. People Operations will arrange a meeting with you, usually within one week of receiving your complaint, so that you can give your account of events. You have the right to be accompanied by a colleague or a trade union representative of your choice, who must respect the confidentiality of the investigation. You will be given a provisional timetable for the investigation, and the investigator will arrange further meetings with you as appropriate throughout the investigation.

Where your complaint is about an employee, we may consider suspending them on full pay or making other temporary changes to working arrangements pending the outcome of the investigation, if circumstances require. The investigator will also meet with the alleged harasser or bully to hear their account of events. They have a right to be told the details of the allegations against them, so that they can respond. Where your complaint is about someone other than an employee, such as a customer, supplier or visitor, we will consider what action may be appropriate to protect you and anyone involved pending the outcome of the investigation, bearing in mind the reasonable needs of the business and the rights of that person. Where appropriate, we will attempt to discuss the matter with the third party.

We will also seriously consider any request that you make for changes to your own working arrangements during the investigation. For example you may ask for changes to your duties or working hours so as to avoid or minimise contact with the alleged harasser or bully. It may be necessary to interview witnesses to any of the incidents mentioned in your complaint. If so, the importance of confidentiality will be emphasized to them.

**Action Following the Investigation**

If People Operations considers that harassment or bullying has occurred, prompt action will be taken to address it. Where the harasser or bully is an employee, the matter will be dealt with as a case of possible misconduct or gross misconduct under our Disciplinary Procedure. If the harasser or bully is a third party such as a customer or other visitor, we will consider what action would be appropriate to deal with the problem. Whether or not your complaint is upheld, we will consider how best to manage any ongoing working relationship between you and the person concerned.

Whether or not your complaint is upheld, we will consider how best to manage the ongoing working relationship between you and the person concerned. It may be appropriate to arrange some form of mediation and/or counselling, or to change the duties, working location, or reporting structure of one or both parties. Any staff member who deliberately provides false information or otherwise acts in bad faith as part of an investigation may be subject to action under our Disciplinary Procedure.

**Appeals**

If you are not satisfied with the outcome you may appeal in writing to People Operations or the Managing Director, stating your full grounds of appeal, within one week of the date on which the decision was sent or given to you. We will hold an appeal meeting, normally within one week of receiving your written appeal. This will be dealt with impartially by a manager who has not previously been involved in the case (although they may ask anyone previously involved to be present). You may bring a colleague or trade union representative to this meeting. We will confirm our final decision in writing, usually within one week of the appeal hearing. This is the end of the procedure and there is no further appeal.

**Protection and Support for Those Involved**

All team members who make complaints or who participate in good faith in any investigation must not suffer any form of retaliation or victimization as a result. Anyone found to have retaliated against or victimized someone in this way will be subject to disciplinary action under our Disciplinary Procedure. If you believe you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform People Operations. If the matter is not remedied, you should raise it formally using our Grievance Procedure or this procedure if appropriate.

**Confidentiality and Record-Keeping**

Confidentiality is an important part of the procedures provided under this policy. Details of the investigation and the names of the person making the complaint and the person accused will only be disclosed on a "need to know" basis. Breach of confidentiality may give rise to disciplinary action under our Disciplinary Procedure. Information about a complaint by or about an employee may be placed on the employee's personnel file, along with a record of the outcome and of any notes or other documents compiled during the process. These will be processed in accordance with our Data Protection Policy.

### *6.3 Stress and Mental Wellbeing at Work*

We are committed to protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of all team members at Fueled. We recognize the importance of identifying and tackling the causes of work-related stress. We also recognize that personal stress, while unrelated to the workplace, can adversely affect the wellbeing of team members at work. We want to support the mental wellbeing of all our staff and will provide appropriate support for those who are suffering from stress or poor mental health, on a confidential basis where appropriate, regardless of its source.

We endeavor to:

1. Promote a culture of open communication. We want everyone to feel confident that any concerns they raise about their work or working environment will be addressed. We will provide both formal and informal means for them to raise concerns.
2. Provide training for managers in good management practices.
3. Take account of stress and mental wellbeing when planning and allocating workloads. We will provide opportunities to discuss these through our appraisal and one-to-one supervision processes.
4. Monitor working hours and overtime to ensure that staff are not overworking and monitor holidays to ensure that staff are using their entitlement.
5. Ensure risk assessments include or specifically address work-related stress.
6. Facilitate requests for flexible working where reasonably practicable in accordance with our Flexible Working Policy.
7. Ensure that in any workplace reorganization our change management, processes are designed to minimize uncertainty and stress.
8. Implement policies and procedures to address factors that can cause stress at work, or add to personal stress, in particular so that we can:
    1. provide a workplace free from harassment, bullying and victimisation; and
    2. address inappropriate behavior through disciplinary action.
9. Provide support for all team members affected by or absent by reason of stress.

**Personnel Responsible for the Policy**

We will monitor the development of good practice in approaches to work-related stress and mental wellbeing at work and will keep our practices and the effectiveness of this policy under review to ensure it is achieving its stated objectives. All managers have a responsibility to recognise potential issues of work-related stress or poor mental health in their direct reports.

All team members should ensure that they are familiar with this policy and act in accordance with its aims and objectives. Staff should plan and organize their work to meet personal and organisational objectives and cooperate with the support, advice, and guidance that may be offered by managers and/or People Operations. Anyone who experiences or is aware of a situation that may result in work-related stress or undermine mental wellbeing at work should speak to a manager.

**Understanding Stress and Mental Health**

**Stress** is the adverse reaction people have to excessive pressures or demands placed on them. Stress is not an illness but, sustained over a period of time, it can lead to mental and/or physical illness.

**Mental health** is a term to describe our emotional, psychological and social well being; it affects how we think, feel, and act and how we cope with the normal pressures of everyday life. Positive mental health is rarely an absolute state since factors inside and outside work affect mental health, meaning that we move on a spectrum that ranges from being in good to poor mental health.

There is an important distinction between working under pressure and experiencing stress. Certain levels of pressure are acceptable and normal in every job. They can improve performance, enable individuals to meet their full potential and provide a sense of achievement and job satisfaction. However, when pressure becomes excessive it produces stress and undermines mental health.

Pressures outside the workplace, whether the result of unexpected or traumatic events such as accidents, illness, bereavement, family breakdown, or financial worries, can result in stress and poor mental health. They can also compound normal workplace pressures. We recognize that individuals react to similar situations in different ways and that what triggers stress and poor mental health varies from person to person.

**Supporting Mental Wellbeing at Work**

We want to ensure that our workplace supports good mental health for all team members. However, we recognize that there may be occasions when events at work or outside work result in staff feeling that their mental health is suffering. Anyone who feels that they are suffering from work-related stress should follow the steps below in addition to making use of the support services referred to in this policy which all staff are encouraged to access if they ever feel they need support or assistance.

All managers should, working with People Operations and through making appropriate referrals to an Occupational Health Advisor, where appropriate, provide support to their team(s). In particular, they need to:

1. Promote a culture of open communication.
2. Effectively plan and provide feedback on performance.
3. Ensure that staff receive necessary training.
4. Monitor workloads and reallocate work where necessary.
5. Ensure that staff understand the standards of behavior expected of them and others, and act on behavior that falls below those standards.

If any member of staff is considered by their manager or colleagues to be at serious risk of self-harm, or of harming others, action must be taken immediately. The matter should be referred to People Operations who will seek medical advice if that is reasonably practicable. Every effort will be made to contact any person nominated by the member of staff as an emergency contact. Where necessary the emergency services will be called. The wellbeing of the member of staff and those around them will at all times be our first concern.

**Addressing Work-Related Stress**

If you believe you are suffering from work-related stress, you should discuss this with your manager or department head as early as possible. If you feel unable to do so you should contact People Operations. Once an issue affecting your health comes to our attention, we will discuss with you what steps can be taken to address that issue. Those steps may include any of the following:

1. A review of your current job role, responsibilities, workload and working hours. Adjustments may be agreed to these, on a temporary basis and subject to further review, where appropriate.
2. Where it appears that stress has been caused by bullying or harassment, investigation under our Disciplinary and/or Grievance Procedures.
3. Referral for medical advice, treatment and/or a medical report to be provided by an Occupational Health Advisor or any specialist or general practitioner who has been treating you.
4. If you are on sickness absence, discussion of an appropriate return to work program. Our Sickness Absence Policy may be applied.

**Absence Due to Stress or Poor Mental Health**

If you are absent due to work-related stress or poor mental health, you should follow the sickness absence reporting procedure contained in your contract and/or our Sickness Absence Policy. In cases of prolonged or repeated absence it may be necessary to apply the procedure set out in our Sickness Absence Policy and/or Capability Procedure.

**Confidentiality**

Information about stress, mental health and mental wellbeing is highly sensitive. Every team member is responsible for observing the high level of confidentiality that is required when dealing with information about stress or mental health, whether they are supporting a colleague or because they are otherwise involved in the operation of a workplace policy or procedure. Breach of confidentiality may give rise to disciplinary action, however, there are occasions when information about stress or mental wellbeing need to be shared with third parties. For example:

1. Where steps need to be taken to address work-related stress such as reallocating work within a team.
2. Where medical advice is required on how to support a member of staff, address issues raised by work-related stress, or address issues raised by poor mental health.
3. Where allegations of harassment, bullying or other misconduct require a disciplinary investigation or proceedings to take place.
4. Where a team member presents an immediate danger to themselves or others.

In these circumstances, wherever possible, matters will be discussed with the team member concerned before any action is taken.

**Protection for Those Reporting Stress or Assisting with an Investigation**

Those who report that they are suffering from work-related stress or poor mental health, who support a colleague in making such a report or who participate in any investigation connected with this policy in good faith will be protected from any form of intimidation or victimization. If you feel you have been subjected to any such intimidation or victimization, you should seek support from your manager, department head, and/or People Operations. You may also raise a complaint in accordance with our Grievance Procedure. If, after investigation, you are found to have provided false information in bad faith, you will be subject to action under our Disciplinary Procedure.

### *6.4 Flexible Working Policy*

We are committed to providing equal opportunities in employment and developing working practices and policies that support work-life balance. This Flexible Working Policy gives eligible employees an opportunity to formally request a change to their working pattern in accordance with the statutory procedure for such requests. Managers are encouraged to facilitate requests unless they cannot be accommodated for business or operational reasons. This policy applies to all team members and does not form part of any employee's contract of employment; we may amend it at any time. Additionally, no one who makes a request for flexible working will be subjected to any detriment or lose any career development opportunities as a result.

**Personnel Responsible for Implementing the Policy**

Managers have a specific responsibility to ensure the fair application of this policy and all members of staff are responsible for supporting colleagues and ensuring its success.

**Forms of Flexible Working**

Flexible working can incorporate a number of possible changes to working arrangements, such as:

1. reduction or variation of working hours;
2. reduction or variation of the days worked; and/or
3. working from a different location (for example, from home).

The possible changes to working arrangements mentioned above may also involve:

1. working a set number of hours a year, rather than a week (annualized hours);
2. working from home (whether for all or part of the week);
3. working only during term-time (part-year working);
4. working compressed hours; and/or
5. working flexi-time.

**Eligibility for the Formal Right to Request**

To be eligible to make a request under this policy, you must:

1. be a full-time employee;
2. have worked for us continuously for at least 26 weeks (6 months) at the date your request is made;
3. not have made a formal request to work flexibly during the last 12 months.

If you are not eligible to make a formal request, you may make an informal request, which is detailed below.

**Making a Formal Flexible Working Request**

Any team member interested in flexible working is advised to speak informally with their manager to discuss their eligibility, the different options and the effect of their proposed work pattern on colleagues and service delivery, before submitting a formal or informal request. You will need to submit a written application if you would like your flexible working request to be considered under the formal procedure. Your application should be submitted to your manager in good time and ideally at least two (2) months before you would like the changes to take effect. It should:

1. state that it is a flexible working request;
2. explain the reasons for your request, especially if you think our Equal Opportunities Policy may be relevant, for example, if your request concerns childcare or other family commitments, religious or cultural requirements, or adjustments because of a disability;
3. provide as much information as you can about your current and desired working pattern, including working days, hours and start and finish times, and give the date from which you want the changes to take effect;
4. identify the effect the changes to your working pattern will have on the work that you do, that of your colleagues and on service delivery. If you have any suggestions about dealing with any potentially negative effects, please include these in your written application; and
5. provide information to confirm that you meet the eligibility criteria of this policy, including the dates of any previous formal requests for flexible working.

In most cases we will need to have a meeting with you before making a decision. In some cases we may be able to approve your request without a formal meeting, although it will usually be helpful to your manager to discuss the request with you to ensure it is the best solution.

**Formal Request: Meeting**

Where necessary, your manager will arrange a meeting with you after your application has been submitted. The meeting may also be attended by your department head, People Operations, and/or the Managing Director. You may bring a colleague to the meeting as a companion if you wish. Your companion will be entitled to speak during the meeting and confer privately with you, but may not answer questions on your behalf. In most cases, the meeting will be held at your usual place of work. We will try to ensure that the meeting is held at a time and place that is convenient to everyone.

The meeting will be used to discuss the working arrangements you have requested. You will be able to explain how the arrangements will accommodate your needs. You will also be able to discuss what impact your proposed working arrangements will have on your work and that of your colleagues. If we cannot accommodate the arrangements you have requested, discussion at the meeting also provides an opportunity to explore possible alternative working arrangements. Your manager may suggest starting new working arrangements under an initial probationary period to ensure that they meet your needs and those of your team.

**Formal Request: Decision**

We will notify you of the decision in writing as soon as possible. If your request is accepted, or where we propose an alternative to the arrangements you requested, your manager will write to you with details of the new working arrangements, details of any probationary period, an explanation of changes to your contract of employment and the date on which they will commence. You will be asked to sign and return a copy of the letter. This will be placed on your personnel file to confirm the variation to your terms of employment.

Unless otherwise agreed (and subject to any agreed probationary period), changes to your terms of employment will be permanent. You will not be able to make another formal request until 12 months after the date of your most recent request. If your manager needs more time to make a decision, for example, where they need more time to investigate how your request can be accommodated or to consult several members of staff, they will discuss this with you.

There will be circumstances where, due to business and operational requirements, we are unable to agree to a request. In these circumstances, your manager or People Operations will write to you:

1. explaining the business reason(s) for turning down your application; and
2. setting out the appeal procedure.

The eight business reasons for which we may reject your request are:

1. the burden of additional costs;
2. detrimental effect on ability to meet client demand;
3. inability to reorganize work among existing staff;
4. inability to recruit additional staff;
5. detrimental impact on quality;
6. detrimental impact on performance;
7. insufficiency of work during the periods that you propose to work; and
8. planned changes.

**Formal Request: Appeal**

If your request is rejected, you have the right to appeal. Your appeal must:

1. be in writing and dated;
2. set out the grounds on which you are appealing; and
3. be sent to People Operations within 14 days of the date on which you received the written rejection of your request.

People Operations will arrange for a meeting to take place following receipt of your appeal. We will try to hold the meeting at a convenient time for all those attending. You may be accompanied by a colleague of your choice. Where possible, the appeal meeting will be conducted by a manager who has not been previously involved in considering your request, up to and including the Managing Director. You will be informed in writing of the decision as soon as reasonably practicable after the appeal meeting.

If your appeal is upheld, you will be advised of your new working arrangements, details of any probationary period, an explanation of changes to your contract of employment and the date on which they will commence. You will be asked to sign and return a copy of the letter. This will be placed on your personnel file to confirm the variation to your terms of employment. You should be aware that changes to your terms of employment will be permanent and you will not be able to make another formal request until 12 months after the date of your original application. If your appeal is rejected, the written decision will give the business reason(s) for the decision and explain why the reason(s) apply in your case. You will not be able to make another formal request until 12 months after the date of your original application.

**Extending Time Under the Formal Procedure**

There may be exceptional occasions when it is not possible to complete consideration of your request within the expected time limits. Where an extension of time is agreed with you, your manager or People Operations will write to you confirming the extension and the date on which it will end.

If you withdraw a formal request for flexible working, you will not be eligible to make another formal request for 12 months from the date of your original request. In certain circumstances, a formal request will be treated as withdrawn. This will occur if you fail to attend a meeting and a rearranged meeting, or an appeal meeting and a rearranged appeal meeting, without good cause. In such circumstances, your manager will write to you confirming that the request has been treated as withdrawn.

**Making an Informal Flexible Working Request**

Employees who are ineligible to make a formal request for flexible working may make an informal request to their manager, who will consider it according to our business and operational requirements. It will help your manager to consider your request if you:

1. make your request in writing and confirm whether you wish any change to your current working pattern to be temporary or permanent;
2. provide as much information as you can about your current and desired working pattern, including working days, hours and start and finish times, and give the date from which you want your desired working pattern to start; and
3. think about what effect the changes to your working pattern will have on the work that you do and on your colleagues, as well as on our service delivery and that of your team. If you have any suggestions about dealing with any potentially negative effects, please include these in your written application. Your line manager can consider whether they are workable.

Your manager will advise you what steps will be taken to consider your request, which may include inviting you to attend a meeting, before advising you of the outcome of your request.

### *6.5 Social Media Policy*

This policy is in place to minimize the risks to our business through the use of social media, and deals with the use of all forms of social media, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and all other social networking sites, internet postings and blogs. It applies to the use of social media for business purposes, as well as personal use that may affect our business in any way. This policy covers all employees, officers, consultants, contractors, volunteers, interns, casual workers and agency workers and does not form part of any employee's contract of employment; we may amend it at any time.

**Personnel Responsible for Implementing the Policy**

Managers have a specific responsibility for operating within the boundaries of this policy, ensuring that all staff understand the standards of behavior expected of them and taking action when behavior falls below its requirements. All team members are responsible for the success of this policy and should ensure that they take the time to read and understand it. Any misuse of social media should be reported to the Operations team.

**Compliance with Related Policies and Agreements**

Social media should never be used in a way that breaches any of our other policies. If an internet post would breach any of our policies in another forum, it will also breach them in an online forum. For example, you are prohibited from using social media to:

1. breach our Equipment and Communications Systems Policy;
2. breach our obligations with respect to the rules of relevant regulatory bodies;
3. breach any obligations contained in those policies relating to confidentiality;
4. breach our Disciplinary Policy or procedures;
5. harass (including sexual harassment) or bully other staff in any way;
6. unlawfully discriminate against other staff or third parties;
7. breach our Data Protection Policy (for example, never disclose personal information about a colleague online); or
8. breach any other laws or regulatory requirements.

Those who breach any of the above policies will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

**Personal Use of Social Media**

Occasional personal use of social media during working hours is permitted so long as it does not involve unprofessional or inappropriate content, does not interfere with your employment responsibilities or productivity, and complies with this policy.

**Prohibited Use**

You must not:

1. make any social media communications that could damage our business interests or reputation, even indirectly;
2. use social media to:
    1. defame or disparage us, our team or any third party;
    2. harass, bully or unlawfully discriminate against a team member or third party;
    3. make false or misleading statements;
    4. impersonate colleagues or third parties;
3. express opinions on our behalf via social media, unless expressly authorized to do so by your manager— you may be required to undergo training in order to obtain such authorisation;
4. post comments about sensitive business-related topics, such as our performance, or do anything to jeopardize our trade secrets, confidential information and intellectual property; and/or

Any misuse of social media should be reported to the Operations team.

**Business Use of Social Media**

If your duties require you to speak on behalf of the organization in a social media environment, you must still seek approval for such communication from your manager, who may require you to undergo training before you do so and impose certain requirements and restrictions with regard to your activities. Likewise, if you are contacted for comments about the organization for publication anywhere, including in any social media outlet, direct the enquiry to your manager and do not respond without written approval. The use of social media for business purposes is subject to the remainder of this policy.

**Guidelines for Responsible Use of Social Media**

1. You should make it clear in social media postings or on your personal profile that you are speaking on your own behalf. Write in the first person and use a personal email address.
2. Be respectful to others when making any statement on social media and be aware that you are personally responsible for all communications which will be published on the internet for anyone to see.
3. If you disclose your affiliation with us on your profile or in any social media postings, you must state that your views do not represent those of your employer (unless you are authorized to speak on our behalf). You should also ensure that your profile and any content you post are consistent with the professional image you present to clients and colleagues.
4. If you are uncertain or concerned about the appropriateness of any statement or posting, refrain from posting it until you have discussed it with your manager.
5. If you see social media content that disparages or reflects poorly on us, you should contact your manager.

**Monitoring**

We reserve the right to monitor, intercept and review, without further notice, staff activities using our IT resources and communications systems, including but not limited to social media postings and activities, for legitimate business purposes which include ascertaining and demonstrating that expected standards are being met by those using the systems and for the detection and investigation of unauthorized use of the systems (including where this is necessary to prevent or detect crime).

**Recruitment**

We may use internet searches to perform due diligence on candidates in the course of recruitment. Where we do this, we will act in accordance with our data protection and equal opportunities obligations.

**Breach of This Policy**

Breach of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Any member of staff suspected of committing a breach of this policy will be required to cooperate with our investigation. You may be required to remove any social media content that we consider to constitute a breach of this policy. Failure to comply with such a request may in itself result in disciplinary action.

### *6.6 Workplace Equipment and Communication Systems Policy*

Fueled’s equipment and communications systems are intended to promote effective communication and working practices within our organization. This policy outlines the standards you must observe when using these systems, the circumstances in which we will monitor your use, and the action we will take in respect of breaches of these standards. This policy covers all employees, officers, consultants, contractors, volunteers, interns, casual workers, agency workers and anyone who has access to our equipment and communication systems.

Misuse of equipment and communications systems can damage the business and our reputation. Breach of this policy may be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure and, in serious cases, may be treated as gross misconduct leading to summary dismissal. This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.

**Personnel Responsible for This Policy**

Managers have a specific responsibility to ensure the fair application of this policy and all team members are responsible for supporting colleagues and ensuring its success. The Operations team will deal with requests for permission or assistance under any provisions of this policy, and may specify certain standards of equipment or procedures to ensure security and compatibility.

**Equipment Security and Passwords**

You are responsible for the security of the equipment allocated to or used by you, and must not allow it to be used by anyone other than those in accordance with this policy. You are responsible for the security of any machine used by you. You should lock your computer or log off when leaving it unattended or upon leaving the office to prevent unauthorized users accessing the system in your absence. Anyone who is not authorized to access our network should only be allowed to use it under supervision.

Desktop computers (such as iMacs), monitors, keyboards, mice, and other computer or electronic equipment should not be moved or tampered with without first consulting the Operations team.

You should use passwords on all equipment, particularly items that you take out of the office. You must keep your passwords confidential and change them regularly. You must not use another person's username and password or make available or allow anyone else to log on using your username and password unless authorized by the Operations team. Upon termination of employment (for any reason), you must provide access credentials to the Operations team and return any equipment, key fobs, and/or cards.

If you have been issued with a laptop, tablet, mobile device, or any other equipment by Fueled, you must ensure that it is kept secure at all times, especially when travelling. Passwords must be used to secure access to data kept on such equipment to ensure that confidential data is protected in the event of loss or theft. You should also be aware that when using equipment away from the workplace, documents may be read by third parties, for example, passengers on public transport.

**Systems and Data Security**

You should not copy, delete, destroy, or modify any existing systems, programs, information, or data (except as authorized in the proper performance of your duties). You must also not download or install software from external sources without prior authorization from your manager, department head, or the Operations team. This includes software programs, instant messaging programs, screensavers, photos, video clips, and music files. Incoming files and data should always be virus-checked before they are downloaded. When in doubt, team members should seek advice from the Operations team.

We monitor all incoming emails for viruses. You should exercise particular caution when opening unsolicited emails from unknown sources or an email which appears suspicious (for example, if it contains a file whose name ends in .exe). Inform the Operations team immediately if you suspect your computer may have a virus. We reserve the right to delete or block access to emails or attachments in the interests of security. We also reserve the right not to transmit any email message.

You should not attempt to gain access to restricted areas of the network, or to any password-protected information, except as authorized in the proper performance of your duties. You must be particularly vigilant if you use our equipment outside the workplace and take such precautions, as we may require from time to time against importing viruses or compromising system security. The system contains information which is confidential and/or subject to data protection legislation. Such information must be treated with extreme care and in accordance with our Privacy Standard.

**Email**

Although email is a vital business tool, you should always consider if it is the appropriate method for a particular communication. Correspondence with third parties by email should be written as professionally; messages should be concise and directed only to relevant individuals.

1. You should access your emails at least once every working day, stay in touch by remote access when travelling in connection with our business, and use an out of office response when away from the office for more than a day. You should endeavor to respond to emails within 24 hours.
2. You must not send abusive, obscene, discriminatory, racist, homophobic, harassing, derogatory, defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate emails. Anyone who feels that they have been harassed or bullied, or are offended by material received from a colleague via email should inform People Operations.
3. You should take care with the content of email messages, as incorrect or improper statements can give rise to claims for discrimination, harassment, defamation, breach of confidentiality or breach of contract. Remember that you have no control over where your email may be forwarded by the recipient. Avoid saying anything which would cause offence or embarrassment if it was forwarded to colleagues or third parties, or found its way into the public domain.
4. Email messages may be disclosed in legal proceedings in the same way as paper documents. Deletion from a user's inbox or archives does not mean that an email cannot be recovered for the purposes of disclosure. All email messages should be treated as potentially retrievable, either from the main server or using specialist software.
5. If you receive an email in error, you should inform the sender.
6. In general, you should not:
7. send or forward private emails at work which you would not want a third party to read;
8. send or forward chain mail, junk mail, cartoons, jokes or gossip;
9. contribute to system congestion by sending trivial messages, copying or forwarding emails to those who do not have a real need to receive them, or using "reply all" unnecessarily on an email with a large distribution list;
10. sell or advertise using our communication systems or broadcast messages about lost property, sponsorship, or charitable appeals;
11. agree to terms, enter into contractual commitments, or make representations by email unless appropriate authority has been obtained. A name typed at the end of an email is a signature in the same way as a name written at the end of a letter;
12. download or email text, music, or other content from the internet subject to copyright protection, unless it is clear that the owner of such works allows this;
13. send messages from another person's email address (unless authorized) or under an assumed name; or
14. send confidential messages via email or the internet, or by other means of external communication which are known not to be secure.

**Using the Internet**

Internet access is provided primarily for business purposes. Occasional personal use may be permitted as set out below. When a website is visited, devices such as cookies, tags, or web beacons may be employed to enable the site owner to identify and monitor visitors. Such markers could be a source of embarrassment to both the visitor and Fueled, especially if inappropriate material has been accessed, downloaded, stored, or forwarded from the website. Such actions may also, in certain circumstances, amount to a criminal offence if, for example, the material is pornographic in nature.

You should not access any web page or download any image, document or other file from the internet which could be regarded as illegal, offensive, in bad taste or immoral. Even web content which is legal may be in sufficient bad taste to fall within this prohibition. As a general rule, if any person (whether intended to view the page or not) might be offended by the contents of a page, or if the fact that our software has accessed the page or file might be a source of embarrassment if made public, then viewing it will be a breach of this policy.

**Personal Use of Our Systems**

We permit the personal use of our internet and email systems, subject to certain conditions set out below. Personal use is a privilege, not a right; it must not be overused or abused. We may withdraw permission for it at any time or restrict access at our discretion.

Personal use must meet the following conditions:

1. use must be relatively minimal;
2. use must not interfere with business or office commitments;
3. use must not commit us to any costs, marginal or otherwise; and
4. use must comply with this as well as our other policies, including the Equal Opportunities Policy, Anti-harassment Policy, Privacy Standard and Disciplinary Rules.

You should be aware that personal use of our systems may be monitored and, where breaches of this policy are found, action may be taken under the Disciplinary Procedure. We reserve the right to restrict or prevent access to certain internet sites if we consider personal use to be excessive.

**Monitoring**

For business reasons, and in order to carry out legal obligations in our role as an employer, use of our systems, and any personal use of them, may be continually monitored by automated software or otherwise. Monitoring is only carried out to the extent permitted or as required by law and as necessary and justifiable for business purposes.

We reserve the right to retrieve the contents of email messages or check internet usage (including pages visited and searches made) as reasonably necessary in the interests of the business, including for the following purposes (this list is not exhaustive):

1. to monitor whether the use of the email system or the internet is legitimate and in accordance with this policy;
2. to find lost messages or to retrieve messages lost due to computer failure;
3. to assist in the investigation of alleged wrongdoing; or
4. to comply with any legal obligation.

**Prohibited Use of Our Systems**

Misuse, excessive personal use, or inappropriate use of the internet will be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure. Misuse of the internet can in some circumstances be a criminal offence. In particular, it will usually amount to gross misconduct to misuse our systems by participating in online gambling, forwarding chain letters, or by creating, viewing, accessing, transmitting or downloading any of the following material (this list is not exhaustive):

1. pornographic material (that is, writing, pictures, films, or video clips of a sexually explicit or arousing nature);
2. offensive, obscene, or criminal material or material which is liable to cause embarrassment to us or to our clients;
3. a false and defamatory statement about any person or organization;
4. material which is discriminatory, offensive, derogatory or may cause embarrassment to others (including material which breaches our Equal Opportunities Policy or our Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy);
5. confidential information about us or any of our team members or clients (except as authorized in the proper performance of your duties);
6. unauthorized software;
7. any other statement which is likely to create any criminal or civil liability (for you or us); or
8. music, video files, or other material in breach of copyright.

Any such action will be treated very seriously and could likely result in termination. Where evidence of misuse is found we may undertake a more detailed investigation in accordance with our Disciplinary Procedure, involving the examination and disclosure of monitoring records to those nominated to undertake the investigation and any witnesses or managers involved in the Disciplinary Procedure. If necessary, such information may be handed to the police in connection with a criminal investigation.

### *6.7 Personal Data Changes*

It is your obligation to provide Fueled with all of your current contact information, including current mailing address, telephone number, and emergency contact information. Please inform People Operations immediately of any changes to your contact, personal, or tax information. This data is held in confidence and will only be used when needed.

### *6.8 Employment of Relatives and Friends*

We will not employ friends or relatives in circumstances where actual or potential conflicts may arise that could compromise supervision, safety, confidentiality, security, and/or morale at Fueled. It is your obligation to inform us of any such potential conflict so we can determine how best to respond to the particular situation.

### *6.9 Conflicts of Interest*

Fueled is concerned with conflicts of interest that create actual or potential job related concerns, especially in the areas of confidentiality, customer relations, safety, security, and morale. Any actual or potential conflict of interest between a team member and a competitor, supplier, distributor, or contractor must be disclosed to the People Operations team. If an actual or potential conflict of interest is determined to exist, we will take such steps as is deemed necessary to reduce or eliminate this conflict.

### *6.10 Nonsolicitation/Nondistribution Policy*

You are prohibited from soliciting other team members during your assigned working time. For purposes of this policy, "solicitation" includes, but is not limited to, selling items or services, requesting contributions, and soliciting or seeking to obtain membership in or support for any organization through verbal, written, or electronic means. “Working time” means time during which either you or the team members who are the object of the solicitation are expected to be actively engaged with assigned work. You may conduct solicitations during breaks or other authorized non-working time, so long as you do so when the other team members are also on non-working time.

To avoid inappropriate litter, clutter, and safety risks, you may not distribute literature or other items that are not work related in working areas at any time. Electronic distribution of materials is prohibited during work time. Literature that violates the company's equal employment opportunity (EEO) and nonharassment policies (including threats of violence), or is knowingly and recklessly false, is never permitted. Non-team members are not permitted to distribute materials on company premises at any time.

This policy is not intended to restrict the statutory rights of team members, including the right to discuss terms and conditions of employment. Violations of this policy should be reported to (in order of escalation) your manager, department head, the People Operations team, or the Managing Director.
